# employee-churn-analysis-prediction
Understanding why and when employees are most likely to leave can lead to actions to improve employee retention as well as possibly planning new hiring in advance.I'll be using both descriptive and inferential statistical approach to understand the drivers of churn happening within the company which will result in core variables attributed to churn will be highlighted . This capstone project would fall under what is commonly known as "HR Analytics".

# Code and Resources Used
<li>Python Version: 3.7</li>
<li>Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn</li>
<li>kaggle article: https://www.kaggle.com/hamzaben/employee-churn-model-w-strategic-retention-plan</li>

**Dataset:**
In this case study, a  fictional HR dataset was sourced from **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** which contains various numerical and categorical features of employee data . I will use this dataset **Capstone2_HR** to predict core key drivers of employee churn.

But for practical purpose :I have named the company "**Star line Co.**" and have created Problem Statement and Issue trees around a fictitious context.
